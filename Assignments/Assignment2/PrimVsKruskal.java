/* PrimVsKruskal.java
   CSC 226 - Summer 2018
   Assignment 2 - Prim MST versus Kruskal MST Template
   
   The file includes the "import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.*;" so that yo can use
   any of the code in the algs4.jar file. You should be able to compile your program
   with the command
   
	javac -cp .;algs4.jar PrimVsKruskal.java
	
   To conveniently test the algorithm with a large input, create a text file
   containing a test graphs (in the format described below) and run
   the program with
   
	java -cp .;algs4.jar PrimVsKruskal file.txt
	
   where file.txt is replaced by the name of the text file.
   
   The input consists of a graph (as an adjacency matrix) in the following format:
   
    <number of vertices>
	<adjacency matrix row 1>
	...
	<adjacency matrix row n>
	
   Entry G[i][j] >= 0.0 of the adjacency matrix gives the weight (as type double) of the edge from 
   vertex i to vertex j (if G[i][j] is 0.0, then the edge does not exist).
   Note that since the graph is undirected, it is assumed that G[i][j]
   is always equal to G[j][i].
